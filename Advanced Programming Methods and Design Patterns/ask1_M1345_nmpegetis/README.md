## Design Patterns

#Implementations for the:
* Observer Pattern, and 
* Bridge Pattern.

1. Two different groups of classes for each.
For the Observer Design Pattern we created a simulation for the water that can be drunk by people. A sensor observes the quality and automatically alerts 2 applications (a web app and a mobile app)
2. For the Bridge Design Pattern we created a simulation of how the apps are implemented for mobile devices (tablet, mobile) that can operate in different operating systems but need similar behaviours and functionalities (e.g. turn on power, turn off power, call, text message, download apps, open and close apps, shoot photos)
