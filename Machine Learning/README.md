## Spring Semester of 2013

## COURSE PROJECT: Using RVM probabilistic classification to list of diseases

# Research on pathogen SNPs for important group of diseases and correlations in SNPs mutations.

In this directory there are included all data used for the report except for the RVM code that I didn't place because it didn't provide a LICENCE. 

This research, though, didn't get the expected results, due to its very general title.

Nevertheless all the data and my own code (Java) are uploaded here.
