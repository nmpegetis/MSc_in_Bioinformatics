Projects from my MSc in Bioinformatics in collaboration of university/research institutes NKUA/NCSR Demokritos/TEI of Athens, Athens, Greece. Please add me in LinkedIn and endorse me for my relevant experience: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nmpegetis/ . The Postgraduate Program "Information Technologies in Medicine and Biology" (I.T.M.B.) is by its very nature intensely interdisciplinary. Its objective is to strengthen the knowledge and skills of its postgraduate students in the application of informatics, applied mathematics, and statistical analysis methods in Life Sciences and Biotechnology. The program focuses on subjects related to the organization, management, processing and analysis of biomedical signals and data, as well as on the development of models, algorithms, analysis methods and software tools for bioinformatics, computational biology and systems biology.
